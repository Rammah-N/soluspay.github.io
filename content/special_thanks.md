Thanks to all of these speical people (in no particular order), who have supported us. Noebs and subsequently Solus is meant for people. We wanted to make a difference, and without the help and trust we found from you, none of that would have happened.

- Amjad (you need a badass, a straight from hell insane man to have a business in Sudan during 2017-2019! Kizan didn't survive this era, dude!)
- Hajir Yousif
- Omer EBS
- Ruaa
- All of Africa City of Technology Staff
- Muhannad
- Jaime (Duh!)
- Hind
- Tilal
- GO team (they made a language that doesn't suck)
- Amri

_All of those lame a**es who thought stealing someone's code (and patenting QR) is cool. Suck it._
